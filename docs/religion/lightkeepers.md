# The Lightkeepers

![](/doloria/img/lightkeepers.jpg)

The Lightkeepers are a spiritual/religious organisation that worship mysterious celestial beings that appeared around the Birth of the Weave. Little is written about these beings, known as the Lightbringers, and the reason for their appearance and dissapearance is still a mystery. It is said by the Lightkeepers that they helped the common folk rise up against the dragons and defeat them. The Lightkeepers believe that these beings watch over all people and will reappear when we need them again.
