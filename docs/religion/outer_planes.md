# The Outer Planes

When a person dies, they either travel through the astral plane to Minos or remain on the material plane as an undead.

Minos stands as the final judgement of souls, by The Unseen One. It serves as the Astral plane, with a more physical existence like the Shadowfell.

From Minos, five rivers take the souls of the dead to their destined resting place

- The Styx – The Evil – The Nine Hells
- The Acheron – The Wild – Acheron/Ysgard
- The Lethe – The Good – Elysium
- The Phlegethon – The Vile – The Abyss
- The Cocytus – The Lost – Limbo/Pandemonium
