# Karantuk's Cascade

More commonly refered to as simply ‘Cascade’ the annual dwarven run, drinking competition started as a celebration of the dwarven god’s gifts. With all clans vying to create the best and finest goods, over time these competitions pivoted on the one commodity dwarves value the most. Ale. So, as other races became involved and cities grew, the tradition began. Who reignes as the finest, best selling and most popular alehouse in Doloria? The rules are simple:

1. Any tavern or Alehouse may purchase its ale from any brewery participating in the Cascade.
2. All barrels and bottles produced for the declared date of Cascade must be branded with the one of a kind annual Cascade seal, or else will not be counted
3. Each Establishment must stack empty barrels and bottles 20 paces from its perimeter to be counted for the competition.
4. Each barrel not of the current competition incurrs a -5 barrel penalty
5. Each legitimately marked general’s bottle of Fireshot or Wodka, counts as one barrel
6. On the conclusion of Cascade, each alehouse must have its consumed containers counted by a randomly selected Confederate Guard Postmaster and sent to Inverhölm within a calculated travel time.
