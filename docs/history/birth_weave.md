# Birth of the Weave

Approximately 1000 years ago, in the last decades of the Reign of the Dragons, magic began to reappear in Doloria among the common folk. What was once a power of the dragons was now manifesting in humans, gnomes and elves over the land. While the ability to harness and control this power was still unknown, this gift signaled a change in the hearts of the people and collective opinions about the rule of the dragons. With a growing movement against the tyranny of the dragons, the combined races led by human paladin Helena Dolor, gnomish wizard Galivox Vitruvian and elven druid Caledor drove the dragons to the edges of the continent, starting the Draconic Fall.

Each race took this emergence of magic differently. Humans heralded it as a gift from The Gods, a reward for their servitude, given to them in a time of need. The elven community reexamined and relearnt the Eladrin Scripts for some way to re-link this plane with the Feywild. The gnomes saw progress and utility in magic and began to research it, eventually creating many of the magic objects and tools seen today.
