# The Capital War

After the Birth of the Weave, two distinct and opposing views of magic started to form as the potential power of new mages was growing. Most mages felt prejudice and fear from most folk and wanted to live under a different set of laws, while a much larger group feared a similar tyrannical rule to that of the dragons and pushed for harsher laws for magic wielders.

These growing tensions in Doloria eventually culminated in the Capital War, between the pro-magic New Dolorians and the conservative Puritans, beginning in 877 D.E. It lasted for 9 years and almost completely destroyed the capital of Verum. The fighting broke the capital apart as boroughs and districts were captured and lost, with neither side able to gain control over the city. A ceasefire was finally reached when the New Dolorians, holding members of the Fairchild Royal Family hostage became surrounded by an overwhelming Puritan army. Seeing no good outcomes, both sides decided to convene and discuss a way for peaceful resolution. Reports of this meeting are varied and differ from both sides. Some reports speak of each side arguing over the conditions, written down the length of a grand dining table in charcoal. Some mention the leaders locking themselves in a meeting room for days to come to some resolution. The new set of laws that were drafted on what is now celebrated as Unification Day, eventually became the Arcanus Legis.
