      <title>Welcome to your campaign!</title>
      <published>2017-08-01T07:34:31Z</published>
      <content gm_only="false" format="textile">Wondering how to get started? Here are a few tips:

h4. &lt;a href="/settings/player-management-settings"&gt;1. Invite your players&lt;/a&gt;

Invite them with either their email address or their Obsidian Portal username.

h4. &lt;a href="/wiki_pages/home-page/edit"&gt;2. Edit your home page&lt;/a&gt;

Make a few changes to the home page and give people an idea of what your campaign is about. That will let people know you're serious and not just playing with the system.

h4. &lt;a href="/settings/style-settings"&gt;3. Choose a theme&lt;/a&gt;

If you want to set a specific mood for your campaign, we have several backgrounds to choose from. Accentuate it by creating a top banner image.

h4. &lt;a href="/characters"&gt;4. Create some NPCs&lt;/a&gt;

Characters form the core of every campaign, so take a few minutes to list out the major NPCs in your campaign.

A quick tip: The "+" icon in the top right of every section is how to add a new item, whether it's a new character or adventure log post, or anything else.

h4. &lt;a href="/posts/new"&gt;5. Write your first Adventure Log post&lt;/a&gt;

The adventure log is where you list the sessions and adventures your party has been on, but for now, we suggest doing a very light "story so far" post. Just give a brief overview of what the party has done up to this point. After each future session, create a new post detailing that night's adventures.

*One final tip*: Don't stress about making your Obsidian Portal campaign look perfect. Instead, just make it work for you and your group. If everyone is having fun, then you're using Obsidian Portal exactly as it was designed, even if your adventure log isn't always up to date or your characters don't all have portrait pictures.

That's it! The rest is up to your and your players.

__The Royal Hounds and Hunters of the Duchy of Clemens__, more commonly referred to as simply _The Hounds_ is an organisation of hunters and trackers working closely with the [[The Triumvirate | Triumvirate]] to pursue and capture outlawed mages for trial. 

h2. Leader

The current leader of the Hounds and the Duchy of Clemens is [[:duke-chester-clemens | Duke Chesterfield Bertram Clemens]], currently in his third year of the position. His father, the late Duke Bertram Alistair Clemens was fatally injured by the outlawed mage Ollphest while attempting his capture. Ollphest escaped into the wilderness and the new Duke and his brothers were left to lead the family after the death of his father.

The Clemens brothers are:
* Duke Chesterfield Bertram Clemens
* Earl Cadbury Byron Clemens
* Earl Clifford Bartholemew Clemens
* Earl Chauncey Burton Clemens
* Earl Cornelius Basil Clemens

h2. History and Operation

Originally an influential noble house, a disdain for users of magic started to form when an remarkably few number of the family manifested magic from the [[Birth of the Weave]]. While most families eventually saw the power in a magic bloodline, the Clemens ostracised those that were "impure".  Tensions between the magic and non magic communities eventually resulted in [[The Capital War | The Capital War]], with the Clemens fighting on the side of the Puritans. With the end of the war and the drafting of [[Arcanus Legis]], the Clemens found themselves suited and well equipped as an organisation for the capture of outlawed mages. 

The Hounds run in 4 man teams, usually with several blink dogs and the Huntsmaster carrying the [[Orders of Capture | Orders of Capture]]. High ranking hounds carry a Huntsmaster's Crossbow, a Gnome engineered specialty crossbow. It fires an incredibly powerful bolt for it's size, which can be easily be concealed by their large coats.

The Hounds operate out of Clemensworth, the family estate several miles east of [[Verum]] and have barracks in the capital and in most major settlements.</content>

      <content gm_only="false" format="textile">Galivox is an underground settlement on the [[Broken Coast]] and the largest Gnomish community in Doloria. 

h2. History

Gnomes were a subterranean race for most of Doloria's history and lived in caves and caverns scattered along it's southern coast. After the [[Birth of the Weave]] and the power of magic started to grow, significant weather changes began to occur all over Doloria. Large sandstorms began appearing on the Broken Coast most with little to no warning. These sandstorms would generate devastating lightning, destroying many small settlements. While most fled for safer environments, the decendants of [[Vitruvians | Galivox Vitruvian]],  remained in the harsh environment with a plan to harness the power of the storms and utilise its energy. Through decades of research and many casualities, those that remained built a city under the red sand and named it in honour of their great leader.

h2. Organisations

Galivox and most of gnomish society is governed by the Vitruvians and other high ranking families in small committees, each tasked to govern an aspect of the local society, such as education, farming, law and order.

Gnomes consider their entire race as a family and value invention and innovation over all. Those that prove themselves as keen students and remarkable creators are often welcomed into higher ranking families and take a new surname. Similarly, all gnomes have the choice to leave a higher ranking family for a simpler life, usually for a profession or ambition. The Vitruvians represent the most brilliant and influential of the gnomes and acceptance to them is a historic and momentous occasion. Gnomes that commit serious crimes against the community are stripped of their surname and most leave gnomish society as a result.</content>

The slender towers of the [[High Elves | High Elven]] city Bel'Shanaar rise effortlessly from the cliffs, grazing the ever-present mist of the [[Aenarion Range | Aenarion mountain range]]. Graceful arches swoop from spire to spire, their faintly rose-hued stonework marbled with gold and silver. 

While they may be found in towns and cities across the realm, Bel'Shanaar is the only official High Elf city. The surrounding mountains are dotted with pristine gardens and winding carved stone and marble paths, connecting the sprawl of homesteads, artisan schools and various other Elven retreats.

High above floats the [[Vaulted Court]], both the political and physical seat of power in the region.

Once a profitable iron mine as the name suggests, it was re-purposed as a prison for outlaws and dangerous criminals. The long tunnels and solid stone pathways provided a perfect framework to resist the increasing power of magic in offenders.

[[Judgement]] was built directly above to facilitate the easier transfer of the convicted and move possible threats of escapees away from [[Verum | Verum]]

The prison is maintained and governed by Warden Zenda Revveshverrenivinn, a skilled designer of locks and traps and Warden Ingrid Conrad, An imposing and brutal enforcer. The more dangerous residents of the mine have specially designed chambers to weaken or resist their abilities.</content>

They are a typically reclusive people, tending to treat the strife of shorter lived races with amusement at best, disdain at worst. 

Since even before the [[Birth of the Weave | Birth of the Weave]] they have maintained a strict, in-house policy of keeping their lawbreakers and cultural deviants under control and out of sight of other races. [[The Venandi]] were formed shortly after magic re-emerged, filling the role in a more official sense as well as keeping arcane practices under watch.

High Elf society functions primarily on a artisan-apprentice system, with the passing of expertise also involving immersion in the lifestyle and tradition of a particular profession. 
Whether Archery or Arcanery, Balladry or Bladecraft, all schools of High Elven thought are raised to an art-form steeped in tradition and students are expected to spend every waking hour dedicated to mastering the forms and every minute in trance meditating on the wisdom of the past. While the length of a tenure and number of students to a master artisan may vary widely depending on the craft, the average arrangement typically lasts just shy of half a century. It is exceedingly rare for a member of any other race to be accepted into this system, let alone thrive.

Bashnya is a town situated in the foothills north of Verum. Originally settled by barbarian raiders, it grew to prominence as a stronghold and, later on, for its religious significance as Helena Dolor's birthplace.

Because of Bashnya's history of barbarism in its inhabitants, mounting political tension prompted the Triumvirate to create a peace deal with Bashnya. In return for protection from threats from over the mountains, Verum provides a popular trade route running directly from the capital to Bashnya. Due to these constant threats, the city holds a strong military presence in the form of the Arm of Dolor.</content>

      <content gm_only="false" format="textile">Approximately 1000 years ago, in the last decades of the [[Reign of the Dragons]], magic began to reappear in Doloria among the common folk. What was once a power of the dragons was now manifesting in humans, gnomes and elves over the land. While the ability to harness and control this power was still unknown, this gift signaled a change in the hearts of the people and  collective opinions about the rule of the dragons. With a growing movement against the tyranny of the dragons, the combined races led by human paladin [[Arm of Dolor | Helena Dolor]], gnomish wizard [[Vitruvians | Galivox Vitruvian]] and elven druid Caledor drove the dragons to the edges of the continent, starting the [[Draconic Fall]]. 

Each race took this emergence of magic differently. Humans heralded it as a gift from [[The Gods]], a reward for their servitude, given to them in a time of need. The elven community reexamined and relearnt the [[Eladrin Scripts]] for some way to re-link this plane with the [[Feywild]]. The gnomes saw progress and utility in magic and began to research it, eventually creating many of the magic objects and tools seen today.</content>

      <title>The Capital War</title>

      <content gm_only="false" format="textile">After the [[Birth of the Weave | Birth of the Weave]], two distinct and opposing views of magic started to form as the potential power of new mages was growing. Most mages felt prejudice and fear from most folk and wanted to live under a different set of laws, while a much larger group feared a similar tyrannical rule to that of the [[Reign of the Dragons | dragons]] and pushed for harsher laws for magic wielders.

These growing tensions in Doloria eventually culminated in the Capital War, between the pro-magic New Dolorians and the conservative Puritans, beginning in 877 D.E. It lasted for 9 years and almost completely destroyed the capital of [[Verum]]. The fighting broke the capital apart as boroughs and districts were captured and lost, with neither side able to gain control over the city. A ceasefire was finally reached when the New Dolorians, holding members of the [[Dolorian Royal Family | Fairchild Royal Family]] hostage became surrounded by an overwhelming Puritan army. Seeing no good outcomes, both sides decided to convene and discuss a way for peaceful resolution. Reports of this meeting are varied and differ from both sides. Some reports speak of each side arguing over the conditions, written down the length of a grand dining table in charcoal. Some mention the leaders locking themselves in a meeting room for days to come to some resolution. The new set of laws that were drafted on what is now celebrated as [[The Dolorian Unification | Unification Day]], eventually became the [[Arcanus Legis | Arcanus Legis]].</content>

Walking through the woods, one might be surprised to discover that they are inhabited at all - their homes are nestled deep within caves or arranged out of viny thickets, as much a part of the landscape as a bird's nest or a wolf's den. As for the elves themselves, they keep to themselves and are not fond of visitors. If a wood elf does not wish to be seen, no man or beast could find them.

There are 4 wood elves hidden in this picture. Find them all!


Everything they need is provided by the forests, so they have little reason to visit the world beyond. Elves are spiritual by nature and have many established rituals and rites to honour their gods. For every elf that harnesses magic and speaks to forest spirits, however, there are twice as many fletchers, skinners, hunters and harvesters. Along with their ingrained link to the spiritual world, they are a pragmatic people who have carved out a comfortable living for themselves in Doloria's farthest corners.

Other races would be forgiven for thinking that their existence is a myth, were it not for a few pioneering wood elves that have established links to the outside world in past years. A few outposts have been established on the outskirts of the forects. Elendor Vale is one such which serves as a trading post between Verum and the rest of elven civilisation.</content>

      <title>Maidens of Mercy</title>
      <published>2017-09-21T03:25:01Z</published>
      <content gm_only="false" format="textile">The Maidens of Mercy are an all-female mercenary group, found in every outpost in Doloria. Their organisation began during the Frenzy, a small but destructive epidemic that began in Bashnya and spread to Verum and beyond. The afflicted suffered from weeping sores, frenetic scratching and hallucinations, before the disease reached its peak in a mad bloodlust that ended only on death. The source of the disease was never discovered, by it was not contagious on contact. While this may have seemed like a benefit, panic arose when the disease began surfacing in remote outposts with no apparent cause. 

Led by the cleric Marien, who was the original Maiden of Mercy, a small group of Pelor's followers ceased their efforts to heal and began to quell the epidemic by killing those who were beyond help. Their methods were met with appalled outrage by many victims' relatives, especially when it emerged that in a small handful of cases, the Frenzy abated on its own. This led to nicknames such as the "Maidens of Death" and "The Merciless". Although the Maiden's methods earned them a number of enemies, they single-handedly ended the epidemic and solidified themselves as effective as any army.

Now, the members of the Maidens are often rogue clerics or ex-soldiers, looking to take the problems of the world into their own hands. Their affiliation with Pelor is in name only, and they come from any number of backgrounds. They are often hired by associations looking for more effective solutions to their problems than negotiation or compromise.

Their symbol is a pair of praying hands superimposed on a sword.</content>

Located one days travel south of [[Verum | Verum]], Lake Na'ah is a large, shallow lake surrounded on most sides by dense and sprawling marshland. While difficult to traverse and navigate to common folk, many tribes of lizardfolk call it home. Due to the aggressive and territorial nature of the tribes, the entrance of the Verum River to Lake Na'ah marks the most southern point along the waterway many sailors and merchants are willing to go. Stories and records travel across the land of lost sailors looking for sunken ruins and great fortune, only to meet their end to these savage water people. Less told are the myths of something far more sinister and dangerous living below the surface.</content>

Judgement stands directly above the [[The Iron Mine | The Iron Mine]] and serves as the judicial centre of the nation, where [[Orders of Capture | Orders of Capture]] are dispached and redeemed and the most dangerous of criminals are tried by [[The Assembly of Tribunes | The Assembly of Tribunes]]. It sits in a dry salt basin, miles from the nearest settlement but still boasts a large number of taverns and alehouses, due to the high number of mercenaries doing business. Stationed here are offices for the [[The Triumvirate | The Triumvirate]], [[Civis Arcanum | Civis Arcanum]], [[The Confederate Guard]], [[The Hounds | The Hounds]] and a number of other mercenary groups.

      <content gm_only="false" format="textile">Named for an ancient Eladrin king that settled there, the Aenarion mountains make up the longest contiguous range in known Doloria.

The northern end is largely unexplored, with dense forests climbing the foothills and peaks, creating some of the most hostile terrain to anyone wishing to remain on the ground.

As one travels south the range becomes dotted sparsely with High-Elven academies and homesteads, connected with increasingly magically maintained pathways, winding through both pristine glades and sheer cliffs alike.

Gnomes consider their entire race as a family and value invention and innovation over all.

Similarly, all gnomes have the choice to leave a higher ranking family for a simpler life, usually for a profession or ambition.

Gnomes that commit serious crimes against the community are stripped of their surname and most leave gnomish society as a result.

The long and usually convoluted gnomish names are a result of families combining, as processes and industries become more complex, using bits of each surname involved in the process, eg the bookbinding family Zandinkkerandunar are decendendants of the papermaking Dunars, the leatherworking Zands, the stitcher Kerands and the gilding Dinkkers

The Vitruvians are the ruling power in gnomish society, originally descended from the gnomish champion, Galivox Vitruvian.

      <title>Elven Society</title>
      <published>2019-03-11T08:51:25Z</published>
      <content gm_only="false" format="textile">High elves all bow before entering an establishment or house or major building, to pay respect to the master craftsmen who worked on it.
Some possible food:
Cidy (sai-dee) smoked or roasted or some kind of cooked bird wrapped in pastry.
Extremely popular snack is candies flowers. Lasts a year (or more with magic and high elven cuisine) and often brought on travels.
Lam’basé - words for a common table wine/sweet wine.

There is a major food festival in early summer every other year or so, which lasts a week where basically everyone who makes food competes to show how great their particular product is vs everyone else, it’s extremely competitive and rivalries have been fought for centuries over whose cheese is better, which recipes for smoked quail is the juiciest, etc etc. school reputations can live and die by how well they do in the festival.

The House of Summers Bitter Flight is a micro climate controlled “retreat” (very high end tavern and brothel) which is constantly set to mid autumn weather.
It’s renowned for their clientele as much as the service.
There is one school which has several branches all dedicated to just mending broken magical items. Just magical items. It’s basically a company and a school all rolled into one.
Tell me to move this to a different conversation if it gets too much, but you did say I could~

The reason why elves have rococo hair - because they have elves who are dedicated to hair styling and care, to the point where it’s expected to have long hair for them to work on. The most extreme styles can never leave bel’shannar, because they would collapse without carefully controlled climates.

To not show respect to a craftsman’s work, or to not thank them for it or to haggle to fiercely is seen as an extreme sign of disrespect to that person, and possibly their school or academy from which they trained. It essentially says, your work is not worthy of my regard, nor regard from your school. There have been blood feuds started over this. No warrior school will send out a student without proper payment, because the customer is paying for the schools name, as well as the student. To haggle with a company or academy too much is to insult the entire company and all its members (which can be deadly if it’s a mercenary company or the like)

Up until a work or craft is produced, published, or is actually created, it can still be stolen, copied or ripped off legally. 

If you are caught forging something, illegally copying someone’s else’s work and claim it as your own after they have already made the thing, you are deep deep trouble - your school may be disgraced, and you may exiled or executed in worse case scenarios. It will ruin your reputation for at least a few hundred years.

Since their fancy/traditional writing style is so complex - there are only some combined words that are still in use. It’s the equivalent of using &amp; for and.
Or the very common ‘the’
Thank you dean for those reference pictures. They have been very helpful.


Most tavern/brothel/retreat type places see themselves as places of respite, relaxation and healing (like very fancy spas) rather than straight up brothels or taverns. There is an entire offshoot of a monk school dedicated to massage, acupuncture and the manipulation of deep tissue in only holistic practices, never using it for combat, but for relaxation and healing.

They are not very common though.

There is an apothecary on the far southern side of bel’shanaar that has Specialised in just the production of scented oils for nearly 1000 years (rumor has it they do a roaring trade in poisons and hallucinogens, but there’s no proof amongst the common populace). This apothecary regularly sends out an apprentice or two to gather rare and fine scented herbs and plants from all over the land for use in oil production, and often recruit those with the most delicate of senses and deftest hands to make their products, as too much of anything can be dangerous, or worse, unpopular with clients.

Monks in High elf society tend to be the most reclusive and secretive of all, with their monasteries and sanctuaries being far away and well hidden even from other elves. Just getting to a monastery is half the test of being accepted. It is in these sanctuaries that the monks will dedicate decades, even centuries to mastering the secrets of their sects. Above many other possible professions or occupations, most monks are required to show the deepest and utmost devotion to their chosen path, with few internal diversions encouraged. Though there are always exceptions.

Amongst high elves, the only crime greater than stealing the work of another and passing it off as your own, is that of teacher or student stealing the others work. The bond between student and teacher, master and apprentice, is practically sacred, and to betray that is an extreme crime, which can bring shame upon you, your guild, your family - parents, partners and descendants alike and potentially your students too. Plagiarism is serious business in Bel’Shanaar and is grounds for banishment from the city, but not from elvish territory (they don’t want anyone to find out that they have these sorts of people in bel’shanaar.) usually these sorts will be banished to a very inaccessible mountain peak or even the forests not to return for a set period of time, if ever.

Some will still attempt to learn form them, if they are great masters, but it is forbidden and frowned upon to even talk about them.
There are folk tales of demons, monsters and bad luck plaguing teachers who pass their students work off as their own, or of students who steal their teachers and are killed horribly or punished in some terrible way when they can not recreate or show those skills.

An example of high elf art - the type that would be seen on nice book or important contract.

&lt;p&gt;If you are caught forging something, illegally copying someone’s else’s work and claim it as your own after they have already made the thing, you are deep deep trouble &amp;#8211; your school may be disgraced, and you may exiled or executed in worse case scenarios. It will ruin your reputation for at least a few hundred years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since their fancy/traditional writing style is so complex &amp;#8211; there are only some combined words that are still in use. It’s the equivalent of using &amp;amp; for and.&lt;br /&gt;
Or the very common ‘the’&lt;br /&gt;
Thank you dean for those reference pictures. They have been very helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most tavern/brothel/retreat type places see themselves as places of respite, relaxation and healing (like very fancy spas) rather than straight up brothels or taverns. There is an entire offshoot of a monk school dedicated to massage, acupuncture and the manipulation of deep tissue in only holistic practices, never using it for combat, but for relaxation and healing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are not very common though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an apothecary on the far southern side of bel’shanaar that has Specialised in just the production of scented oils for nearly 1000 years (rumor has it they do a roaring trade in poisons and hallucinogens, but there’s no proof amongst the common populace). This apothecary regularly sends out an apprentice or two to gather rare and fine scented herbs and plants from all over the land for use in oil production, and often recruit those with the most delicate of senses and deftest hands to make their products, as too much of anything can be dangerous, or worse, unpopular with clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monks in High elf society tend to be the most reclusive and secretive of all, with their monasteries and sanctuaries being far away and well hidden even from other elves. Just getting to a monastery is half the test of being accepted. It is in these sanctuaries that the monks will dedicate decades, even centuries to mastering the secrets of their sects. Above many other possible professions or occupations, most monks are required to show the deepest and utmost devotion to their chosen path, with few internal diversions encouraged. Though there are always exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amongst high elves, the only crime greater than stealing the work of another and passing it off as your own, is that of teacher or student stealing the others work. The bond between student and teacher, master and apprentice, is practically sacred, and to betray that is an extreme crime, which can bring shame upon you, your guild, your family &amp;#8211; parents, partners and descendants alike and potentially your students too. Plagiarism is serious business in Bel’Shanaar and is grounds for banishment from the city, but not from elvish territory (they don’t want anyone to find out that they have these sorts of people in bel’shanaar.) usually these sorts will be banished to a very inaccessible mountain peak or even the forests not to return for a set period of time, if ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some will still attempt to learn form them, if they are great masters, but it is forbidden and frowned upon to even talk about them.&lt;br /&gt;
There are folk tales of demons, monsters and bad luck plaguing teachers who pass their students work off as their own, or of students who steal their teachers and are killed horribly or punished in some terrible way when they can not recreate or show those skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example of high elf art &amp;#8211; the type that would be seen on nice book or important contract.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

A solid, imposing figure, heavily armoured. On her chestplate is the praying hands of the Maidens of Mercy, haloed by the starburst worn by followers of Pelor. 

Sefina is a cleric working for the Maidens of Mercy. While most Maidens take the tenets of the organisation as permission to "kill first and ask questions later", Sefina prefers to use her considerable magical ability to heal, defuse violence, and kill only as a last resort. Her work centres mostly on independent peacekeeping in Syndoril, home of the jungle elves. Her reputation as a just and fair warrior has made her a de facto sheriff in the town. While she does not often indulge in mercenary work of hunting bounties and chasing after call-to-arms, she nonetheless enjoys a comfortable lifestyle sponsored by the beneficiaries of her good-doing.
 
She is Saoirse's mentor.</content>
