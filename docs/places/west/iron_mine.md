# The Iron Mine

![](/doloria/img/iron_mine.jpg)

Once a profitable iron mine as the name suggests, it was re-purposed as a prison for outlaws and dangerous criminals. The long tunnels and solid stone pathways provided a perfect framework to resist the increasing power of magic in offenders. More powerful mages are kept in the lower levels of the prison, where some report voices calling from even further down. Judgement was built directly above to facilitate the easier transfer of the convicted and move possible threats of escapees away from Verum

The prison is maintained and governed by Warden Zenda Revveshverrenivinn, a skilled designer of locks and traps and Warden Ingrid Conrad, An imposing and brutal enforcer. The more dangerous residents of the mine have specially designed chambers to weaken or resist their abilities.
