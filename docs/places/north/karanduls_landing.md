# Karandul's Landing

Located south of Thrum and accross the Ulkan Lok from their brother town Rendraw City, Karandulâ€™s Landing is a prosperous trade and fishing town, and a major commodities market of the mineral rich mountains to the north. The townsfolk pray to Karandul and Karangan for calm seas and clear skies, as the Great Lake is such an important economic and spiritual part of the society.
