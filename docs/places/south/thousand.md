# Thousand

Located a days travel south of Verum, Thousand is a small mining town, named after the year the Bostock family discovered a rich gold vein in itâ€™s hills. The Bostocks have created a small fortune mining and refining the ore from their several mines in the region and supplying the Verum jewelers and treasury.
