# Mother's Grotto

As the single largest halfling settlement, Mother's Grotto is home to the more settled and elderley, and more notably the grand halfling collection that has been amassed over centuries and predates most cities. The collection grows with every community that passes through, adding their finds to the collection, either where they can find room or in a new, hastily made structure. As a result, Mother's Grotto is a ramshackle town of winding narrow alleys and teetering buildings, filled to the brim with all manner of random and unsorted objects. Only a small number of the longer lived residents know where to find specific items and even then, the oldest parts of the collection contain treasures unseen for decades, to be found once again by the next generation of inquisitive hunters.

> Fun Fact
>
> Mother's Grotto is technically the largest library in Doloria. While it is not housed in a single structure and has no organisational structure of any kind, the sheer, undisputed amount of books easily surpass the libraries at the Volkzauber Academy, the Assembly or any of the Elven Libraries.
