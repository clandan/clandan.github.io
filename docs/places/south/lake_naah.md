# Lake Na'ah

![](/doloria/img/lake_naah.jpg)

Located one days travel south of Verum, Lake Na’ah is a large, shallow lake surrounded on most sides by dense and sprawling marshland. While difficult to traverse and navigate to common folk, many tribes of lizardfolk call it home. Due to the aggressive and territorial nature of the tribes, the entrance of the Verum River to Lake Na’ah marks the most southern point along the waterway many sailors and merchants are willing to go. Stories and records travel across the land of lost sailors looking for sunken ruins and great fortune, only to meet their end to these savage water people. Less told are the myths of something far more sinister and dangerous living below the surface.
