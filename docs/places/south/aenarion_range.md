# Aenarion Range

Named for an ancient Eladrin king that settled there, the Aenarion mountains make up the longest contiguous range in known Doloria.

The northern end is largely unexplored, with dense forests climbing the foothills and peaks, creating some of the most hostile terrain to anyone wishing to remain on the ground.

As one travels south the range becomes dotted sparsely with High-Elven academies and homesteads, connected with increasingly magically maintained pathways, winding through both pristine glades and sheer cliffs alike.
