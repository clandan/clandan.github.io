# The Vaulted Court

Suspended in the mist over Bel’Shanaar, it is said the Vaulted Court was originally fabricated and set aloft during the long and intense celebration amongst the High Elven people following the Birth of the Weave. It quickly became an icon of pride and symbolic of the invigorated connection of the High Elves to the arcane and almost all of them flocked to Bel’Shanaar over the following years.

The Court has since housed the High Council and hosts political delegations from the Wood Elves of Syndoril and the Drow cluster-city Korhandis and, in turn, selects a candidate for The Triumvirate.

The name refers to both the physical structure as well as the political body that meets within.
