# Assembly of Tributes

After The Capital War, and the events of The Dolorian Unification criminal proceedings needed to be held by a impartial third party of magistrates. The Assembly of Tributes was formed, as a council of varying backgrounds and beliefs to act as judges for the criminals of Doloria.

All auditors, senators and judges form the assembly, with each contributing a vote to judicial decisions. On each piece of evidence, information or testimony collected, a report is written and these reports are collated and a verdict is reached.
