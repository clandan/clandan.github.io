# Confederate Guard

The Confederate Guard was formed after the Confederation of Doloria as a law enforcement organisation for the rebuilt Verum. Mages and fighters alike are allowed to join and undergo rigorous weapon training and studies to become official guards. Their area of operation has spread to most major cities around central Doloria.

Important news and orders are carried by the elite Postmaster wing of the Guard, comprised of the fastest and most adept horse riders in Doloria.

## Orders of Capture

An Order of Capture is a document from the Triumvirate allowing the capture of a suspected outlaw, in accordance with the Arcanus Legis. A legal Order of Capture must be obtained from a Confederate guard office and returned with a captured outlaw to receive the reward. Only one Order of Capture exists for most criminals, thus creating a competitive environment for mercenaries looking to make their living from them. 

Open Orders of Capture exist for the worst criminals and allow any person to claim a reward on their capture, dead or alive.
